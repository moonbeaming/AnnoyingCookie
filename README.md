# Annoying Cookie Consent Form

## About Project

This is a website I created with what I learnt from Scrimba's Frontend Career Path Course, using HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript. It mimics how cookie consent forms pop up on almost every website. Assets are from [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/). You can access the web site [here](https://annoying-cookie.vercel.app/).

## Features

- After a few moments, a popup appears asking for the user's email and name
- Popup cannot be closed unless the fields are filled
- After the form is filled, a popup waits a fixed amount of time to get to the last popup
- Last popup mentions the name the user had provided

## Skills Used/Learned

Through this project, I picked up essential Javascript concepts like how to use:
- setTimeout
- element.style
- formData & .get()
- event.preventDefault
- toggle()
